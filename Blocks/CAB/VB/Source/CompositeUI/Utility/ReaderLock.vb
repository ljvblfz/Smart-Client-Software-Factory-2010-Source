''' <summary>
''' Helper class that makes it easier to ensure proper usage of a <see cref="ReaderWriterLock"/> 
''' for readers by providing support for <see cref="IDisposable"/> and the using keyword.
''' </summary>
''' <example>
''' Common usage is as follows:
''' <code>
''' Dim myLock As ReaderWriterLock = New ReaderWriterLock()
''' 
''' ' Inside some method
''' Using New ReaderLock(rwLock)
'''		' Do your safe resource read accesses here.
'''	End Using
''' </code>
''' If a timeout is specified, the <see cref="LockBase.TimedOut"/> property should be checked inside the 
''' using statement:
''' <code>
''' Dim myLock As ReaderWriterLock = New ReaderWriterLock()
''' 
''' ' Inside some method
''' Using l As ReaderLock = New ReaderLock(rwLock, 100)
'''		If l.TimedOut = False Then
'''			' Do your safe resource read accesses here.
'''		Else
'''			Throw New InvalidOperationException("Could not lock the resource.")
'''		End If
'''	End Using
''' </code>
